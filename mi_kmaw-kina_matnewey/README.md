## Test and Deploy

## Name

Mi'kmaw Kina'matnewey

## Description

The purpose of the game is to create an engaging and interactive experience to promote the learning of Mi'kmaq content. It was created using C in Unity, intended for mobile app deployment. The game involves a user who is able to use a character to match Mi’kmaq words (given by a Boss) to an image and obtain coins for correct answers, or lose “lives” for incorrect ones. 3 incorrect answers would require the user to restart. This game features 2D-scrolling, similar to Mario and Sonic games. It includes boss-battles that involve matching corresponding Mi’kmaq words to defeat said boss.
